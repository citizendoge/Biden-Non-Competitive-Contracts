The goal of this project was to identify and analyze non-competitive federal contracts awarded during President Biden’s lame duck period — a timeframe that carries a higher risk of rushed or inefficient government spending. Non-competitive contracts are awards made without full and open competition, often justified by urgency, sole-source eligibility, or other exceptions that bypass a competitive bidding process. By filtering for contracts with positive unspent balances, I focused on obligated taxpayer dollars that hadn’t yet been deployed. After cleaning and aggregating the data, I was left with 1,613 contracts totaling over $710 million in unspent funds. The visual highlights the top 10 recipients by total unspent amount, and the full dataset is included in the repo. This isn’t an accusation — it’s just a focused snapshot that raises questions worth asking. The raw data was pulled directly from USAspending.gov on April 2, 2025 and can be accessed here:
